# 🧬 Computational Biology Learning Repository

Hi, I'm **Noyonika Parulekar** — a biospecimen coordinator currently learning Linux, Git, and coding tools for biological data management and analysis.  
This repository documents my learning process as I build the foundational technical skills to transition from experimental biology to computational and data-driven research.
