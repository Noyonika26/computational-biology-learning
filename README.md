# Computational Biology Learning
Welcome! 👋  
This repository documents my progress as I strengthen my computational biology and data analysis skills.  
It includes practice scripts, notes, and small exercises from courses and tutorials I’m currently completing in:

- Linux / Command Line
- Git & GitHub
- Python programming
- Introductory Bioinformatics
- Data analysis & visualization

## Goals
- Build a solid foundation in computational tools used in biological research.
- Learn how to navigate and manage data using Linux and Git.
- Develop proficiency in Python for biological data analysis.
- Connect computational methods to real biological applications.

## Current Learning Resources

- [Coursera – Bioinformatics Specialization (UC San Diego)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics)

## About Me
I’m a biology researcher transitioning into computational biology.  
My background includes molecular biology, protein analysis, and microscopy — and I’m now expanding into data-driven approaches for biological discovery.
