## Getting Started with Linux

1) Choosing a Linux distribution
- Linux distributions, or distros, are variations of the Linux operating system, each with unique tools and configurations.
- All distros share the Linux kernel but differ in software packages, support duration, and target use cases (e.g., servers, desktops, embedded devices).
- Popular desktop distros include Ubuntu, Debian, and Linux Mint, while server distros include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu Server.
- Knowing the differences between distros is important, especially when following tutorials or seeking help.
- Ubuntu is broadly used -> recommended for beginners

2) Planning your system
- Decide on your goals for using Linux to choose the appropriate distribution and setup.
- Consider whether you need a desktop environment or just command-line access.
- Options for running Linux include virtual machines, native installs, live boot environments, and cloud services.

3) Installing Ubuntu in VirtualBox
- VirtualBox Installation: Download and install VirtualBox on your operating system.
- Ubuntu Download: Download the Ubuntu Desktop Linux ISO image from ubuntu.com.
- Virtual Machine Setup: Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox, allocate memory, CPUs, and set up the virtual hard disk.
- Ubuntu Installation: Install Ubuntu in the virtual machine by following the prompts and configuring settings like language, keyboard, and user account.
- Post-Installation: Restart the virtual machine, log in, and start exploring your new Linux environment.

4) Using Ubuntu Desktop
- Graphical Interface: Learn to navigate the GNOME desktop, the default for Ubuntu Desktop Linux, and use the app selector menu to find and install applications.
- System Settings: Access and modify system settings, such as display resolution and network settings, through the Settings application.
- File System Navigation: Browse the file system using the Files app, starting with your home directory and exploring other locations.
- Terminal Usage: Open the Terminal application to work with the command-line interface, using basic commands like cd, mv, cp, and the man command for help documentation.
